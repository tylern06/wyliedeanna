				<h1>Our Story</h1>
				<h6>A serendipitous meeting</h6>
				<p>
				I first met Belinda while I was playing basketball with my boys at the Nintendo courts. I saw her sitting on the side with Shuk, painting her nails and in between a game, I walked by and introduced myself but she obviously blocked that memory because she does not recall meeting me AT ALL. So the real date when the stars were aligned, is February 3rd of 2012. It is a day that neither of us will ever forget! Daniel and Shuk had decided to host a Super Bowl potluck party and ironically both of us decided to bring wings. If you didn’t know, I loves wings and Belinda is known for making her wings... Let's just say Belinda's first impression of me wasn't great. I was stealing her shine! Her first words to me that day were “Uhhh my wings are better than yours!” I would say that was the bulk of the excitement of our introduction; arguing over wings the first 10 minutes and watching the game - or trying to, at least. She definitely had my attention, I didn't tell her, but her wings were way better than the store brought wings Bryan and I brought! I still like to argue that mine were better though! Not only is her cooking skills on point, but her smile and laugh got me hooked. Andrea and her were prepping and chatting, and I couldn't help but notice how infectious her smile and laugh was. LOL The next part is Belinda’s most memorable party of the day. The game was going to start soon so it was time to claim our area! Belinda was sitting on the couch with the girls and I had strategically sat on the ground, in front of her, placing my big head in her way. She wanted to say something but felt mean and decided to just deal with it. We would like to tell you more of what happened that night, but being the shy type, putting my head in the way was my move to get noticed. Later that evening, after we both got home, I texted Shuk to ask for Belinda's number, even though we did exchange much word to each other the ENTIRE night. LOL This turned out to be just my style, awkward and weird! Then we got to talking - From there we could say is history!

				<h1>The Proposal</h1>
				<p>
				It was no surprise to both of us that we were going to be engaged in the near future. But little did I know, near future came a lot sooner than expected. On June 6th 2017, what seemed like another dreadful Monday morning became one of the most memorable day in our lives. We started the day trying to figure out the biggest question ever, what dinner is going to be! Lol both being indecisive, Josh made the executive decision of picking me up after work and we will grab whatever I want from Uvillage. This worked for me since I thought we can kill two birds with one stone- dinner and grocery shopping! When we got to UVill, we grabbed some Chipotle then walked around trying to soak in all the sun Seattle was having. It was so nice hanging out, I forgot we needed to head home to take Bruno, our dog, out.

				On our way home, I can’t believe I didn’t see the little signs leading up to the proposal. Josh was finicky on our drive home and right as we arrived home, everything felt off. He leaves his backpack in the car then insists that he grabs it from the car in the middle of taking Bruno out on a walk (never happens), room doors were opened (I never forget to close the doors!), Josh making me feel like I am going crazy, and him wanted to go the long way around (he never does)!
				</p>
				<p>
				​When it finally came time, it was the most perfect josh&	belinda way he could’ve done it! We walked to the park, unleashed Bruno, and sat down to enjoy the view. We were talking about something random then out of nowhere he said that he had a surprise for me. I still had no idea. He pulled out our adventure book and said “I know it’s been awhile since we’ve added to our adventure book so I thought I would take the liberty." I opened the book to where the bookmark was and there was a note josh had written about his love for me and how excited he is for what the future has in stored for us.  Josh also added photos of us with little notes to show that although we haven’t added to their book, the adventures live on. After the note and a few pages of photos, everything moved so fast and became a blur. I turned to the last page of the pictures and as I turned the page, Josh got up, intended to kneel on one knee, but instead the nerves hit him and he fell to the ground. I was so confused and worried. Josh then tries to say my name but slurs it as if he’s drunk. Josh dismissed my concern and said he’s fine and he had something to ask. I was so shocked and only heard blah blah my heart blah blah blah marry me. My immediate response was “NOOO…., can we please redo this after I get ready!” I wanted to look presentable in pictures but josh still nervous and emotional, told me that I look gorgeous and we can’t redo it haha and said well… I latched onto him, kissed him, and said DUHHHH! OF COURSE!!! We hugged and reminisced the moment as mosquitoes bit us.
